# Repo-Template

This template has undergone many revisions, so repositories using it may differ. Not all elements here are necessary, and some may be redundant. Updates to this template will not be propagated to existing repositories due to time and effort constraints.

## Folder Structure

- `/`: Contains essential root files (e.g., `README.md`, `.gitignore`, workspace file).
- `/src`: All project source code resides here. Builds will focus on this directory.
- `/docs`: Contains project documentation. By default, it includes a workflow to set up GitHub Pages, but additional configuration in settings might be required.
- `/.github`: Contains GitHub-related configurations (e.g., workflows, templates, configs).

## Workflows

- Greetings
