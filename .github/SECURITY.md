# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose it publicly** until we have had a chance to address it.
2. Send an email to <security@holeinonestudios.org> with the details of the vulnerability.
3. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any potential impact.

We will acknowledge your report and work to investigate and address the issue as soon as possible. Once the issue is resolved, we will post an update in the repository. If you have a solution feel free to include that too.

Thank you for helping to keep our project secure.
